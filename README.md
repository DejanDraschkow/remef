# remef

`remef` is an R package designed for the removal of statistical effects.

The aim of `remef` is to provide tools for extracting partial effects from
data. 

Mixed-effetcs models include both fixed and random effects. The dependent
variable is expressed as a combination of fixed and random effects and an
error term. `remef` is a practical tool for removing any combiantion
of fixed and random effects from the data. The removal of effects is very
helpful for understanding and visualizing certain effects in highly 
complex statistical models. Currently, the package works with objects 
generated by the package `lme4`.

Key features:

- removes fixed effects and random variance from a dependent variable.

- optinally, `remef` takes into account associated lower-order or 
  higher-order effects when removing partial effects (this is important
  for statistical models including interactions).
  
- finds model coefficients for a given term (e.g., for factors and
  polynomial contrasts) and vice versa.


## Installation

To get the current development version from github, you can use the package
